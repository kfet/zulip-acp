## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- Initial release: a relay bridging a self-hosted Zulip server to an
  ACP-speaking coding agent (`fir --mode acp`) over stdio.
- `internal/zulipproto`: HTTP Basic API client (send/edit/get messages,
  one-shot multipart uploads, stream resolution) plus the
  `POST /register` + `GET /events` long-poll runner with `last_event_id`
  cursor discipline, `BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID` re-registration, heartbeat
  liveness and jittered backoff.
- `internal/rollover`: a pure, surface-agnostic message splitter that
  keeps every posted message under Zulip's 10000 **code point**
  `MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH` — Zulip truncates silently, so the relay counts
  for itself. Fence-aware (closes and reopens fenced code blocks with
  their language tag across a seal), line-boundary preferring, and
  never re-edits a sealed message.
- `internal/journal`: durable `(stream_id, topic)` → conversation-id
  alias map, so a topic rename migrates the session instead of
  orphaning it, plus the owned tail-message id used for crash backfill.
- `internal/handler`: inbound-event gating, ACP prompt dispatch, and a
  streaming sink that coalesces edits on a ~300ms tick.
- `internal/statusline`: Zulip-markdown renderer for the
  `dev.acp-kit.status-line/v1` mood/plan header.
- On startup any unsealed tail message the relay authored is marked
  `*(relay restarted — turn interrupted)*`.
